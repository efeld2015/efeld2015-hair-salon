# Soleil Hair Salon
A sleek, responsive website for a hair salon. 'Soleil' means 'sun' in French and is pronounced 'so-lay.'

# How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS

I took this as a chance to really lean into my design skills; I chose an earth-toned color palette, photos that illustrated the types of clients the 
salon wanted to attract, added subtle hover effects on buttons, and aimed to use a minimal amount of text to keep the site neat and easy to use.
I used CSS Flexbox for positioning elements and media queries for making the site responsive. 

# Optimizations
Eventually I will add
-an appointment booking feature

# Lessons Learned
Ran into issues with images not responding to smaller browser sizes, so this made me brush up on media queries
When working on the layout, and then styling my various containers, it was super helpful to outline each container and/or column in a bright color
so I could see how the code would change the area I was working on at any given time. Then I deleted the outlines when the project was completed.
